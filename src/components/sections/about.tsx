  "An MBA in Finance, followed by hands-on experience at a Portfolio Management Services firm, managing real portfolios for real clients. That time inside the industry was invaluable. But it also revealed something uncomfortable about the Indian investment industry.",
  "Everyone was running behind AUM. The bigger the number, the better the story. And the story was almost always built on narratives, on gut calls, on what some analysts felt would happen next quarter. Very few people were asking the harder question: What does the data actually say?",
  "Because here is the truth about investing that the industry does not want to say out loud; investing is not art. It is science. Markets have patterns. Price has memory. Risk has structure. And when you strip away the noise, the narratives, and the emotions, what remains is a process. A repeatable, disciplined, data-driven process that does not need to guess because it already knows what to look for.",
  "That belief is what Voyyage was built on.",
  "Voyyage exists because Indian investors deserve better than stories. They deserve a firm that treats their money with the same rigor that the best quantitative funds in the world apply to theirs. A firm where every allocation, every entry, every exit is governed by rules and data and nothing else.",
